Wordpress: using Charts.js and Advanced Custom Fields to have website charts that can be easily edited in the WordPress back-end.

Dependencies:
<ul>
   <li>Advanced Custom Fields plugin installed and activated in WordPress.</li>
   <li>A number field created in ACF</li>
   <li>Chart.js installed, in this example I'm using Chart.js 2.5.0</li>
</ul>

In this example, we have a simple donut chart that is using a number field from ACF to display the chart.
