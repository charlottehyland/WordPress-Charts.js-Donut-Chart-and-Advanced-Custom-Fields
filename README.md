Wordpress Code Snippet: using Charts.js and Advanced Custom Fields to have website charts that can be easily edited in the WordPress back-end.

Dependencies:
<ul>
   <li>Advanced Custom Fields plugin installed and activated in WordPress.</li>
   <li>A number field created in ACF</li>
   <li>Chart.js installed, in this example I'm using Chart.js 2.5.0</li>
</ul>

In this example, we have a simple donut chart that is using a number field from ACF to display the chart.

Here's the final product, please note, this snippet only shows how to build out the chart, not adding the number in the middle, or the caption:<br/>
<div style="margin: 10px auto; text-align: center;"><img src="http://charlottehyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/donut-chart.png"/></div>
